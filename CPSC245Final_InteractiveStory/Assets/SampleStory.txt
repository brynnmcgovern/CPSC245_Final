Sandie woke up one morning in a mysterious forest.
Standing above her was an elderly dog with long fur dangling from its face like a beard.
The old dog said, "Young one, there is a grand adventure ahead of you!"
Sandie had no idea what this weird grandpa of a dog was talking about.
Still, the elderly dog continued on.
Elderly Dog: "The world is in danger, and you are the only one who can save it."
Elderly Dog: "But it's dangerous to go alone! Take this."
The elderly dog digs up a sword from beneath a nearby pile of leaves.
Sandie didn't really listen to anything the old dog had said, but she did like swords.
The elderly dog pushes the sword across the forest floor towards Sandie.
Sandie takes the sword in her jaws and raises her head high.
It's not as cool as when humans do it because the sword is sticking out sideways, not upwards.
But Sandie is pleased nonetheless and swings the sword back and forth.
The elderly dog retreats into the forest after Sandie's sword swings far too close for comfort.
And so, Sandie's lonely hero's journey begins.
