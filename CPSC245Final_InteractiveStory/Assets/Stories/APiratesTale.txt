@One day, you find yourself out on the ocean.
@You are the captain of a humble crew. A pirate captain.
*&What kind of captain are you?
In any case, you and your crew have gotten quite used to the way things are.
@And today is a day like any other.
Well, it was supposed to be.
@There's a storm brewing. It's close. Dark. Dangerous.
*&What will you do?
@And just like that, you're alone again, looking out at the darkening clouds. 
@This storm is worse than anything you've seen in all your years on the open seas. 
This may just be the most intense adventure of your entire swashbuckling career.
@But we'll never get to know the result, since this story is just an example.
Maybe you die. Maybe you find some treasure on the ocean floor or something. Who knows?
The end. 
::1A kind captain
#1Despite your swashbuckling and skulduggery, you are a gentle soul.
#1You always share the riches from the treasure you find (steal) equally among your men.
#1;;You are well respected, but there are whispers that you may be too soft for the sea...
::2A tough captain
#2You are a pirate, through and through. Cold. Heartless. Violent. Strong.
#2Struggling a bit with scurvy, but a bit of illness isn't enough to take you down.
#2You are strict with your crew, and cruel with your enemies. You get the job done.
#2Your men are rich, and you, of course, are richer. The lackeys can't complain of empty pockets.
#2;;Though you do sometimes catch whispered complaints of their dislike of you.
::1Confer with your crew
#1@You turn to your first mate, beside you at the helm.
#1//First Mate//It's not looking good, is it, Captain?
#1//First Mate//I think I'll start telling the others to prepare for the worst.
#1//First Mate//If that's alright with you, of course.
#1;;You send your first mate on their way to prepare for the storm.
::2Start giving orders
#2You immediately turn and bark orders at the closest pirate.
#2@//Pirate//Yes, Captain. I'll let the crew know to prepare right away.
#2//Pirate//...Would it kill you to say please sometimes?
#2You grab the hilt of your sword the second you hear their grumbled complaint.
#2//Pirate//Nevermind, Captain! No thanks necessary. I'll be going now.
#2;;The pirate runs off to prepare, grumbling all the while.
