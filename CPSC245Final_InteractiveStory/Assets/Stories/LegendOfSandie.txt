@Sandie woke up one morning in a mysterious forest.
@Standing above her was an elderly dog with long fur dangling from its face like a beard.
The old dog said, "Young one, there is a grand adventure ahead of you!"
*Sandie contemplated the old dog's words.
The elderly dog briefly acknowledged Sandie's response and continued on.
@//Elderly Dog//"The world is in danger, and you are the only one who can save it."
//Elderly Dog//"But it's dangerous to go alone! Take this."
@The elderly dog digs up a sword from beneath a nearby pile of leaves.
@*&Sandie stared at the sword.
The old dog looked at Sandie, trying to gauge her thoughts.
@The elderly dog pushed the sword across the forest floor towards Sandie.
@Sandie immediately took the sword in her jaws and raised her head high.
*It wasn't as cool as when humans did it because the sword was sticking out sideways, not upwards.
@Sandie gave the sword a few practice swings, nearly dropping it into the dirt.
@The elderly dog retreated into the forest after Sandie's sword swung far too close for comfort.
@And so, Sandie's epic journey began.
//Sandie//"Woof!"
